To connect to each individual machine use "vagrant ssh {server name}"
If making changes to the ansible files, make sure to type "vagrant provision" to check the desired result has been achieved.
See link under 'Training and Resources' to view the ansible structure we have followed.


## Ansible Lint
Firstly, use the workon command to switch to your virtual environment.  Type the following command to install the ansible-lint tool: 

    pip install ansible-lint

On the command line, type ansible-lint and then tab to your site.yml file.  Ansible-lint will check your yaml code for indentation and syntax errors.

# Git Setup

Pre-hooks

find a file called "pre-commit" move this file to your .git/hooks folder
run the following command: chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
